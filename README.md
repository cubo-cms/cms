# What's new in version 2.0?
A complete overhaul of **Cubo _CMS_**, introducing more logic and abstraction of classes. New in this version is that components like "admin", "install", "api", are now sub-packages which can be individually installed. In Cubo CMS we also refer to these as _routes_.
We're introducing Packagist to deploy the framework easily.
